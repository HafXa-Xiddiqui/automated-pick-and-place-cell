# Automated Pick-and-Place Cell

## Overview

This project implements a ROS2-based automated pick-and-place cell. The system simulates a robotic workflow where items are placed on a scanning table, scanned for barcodes, and then sorted into pockets or reject areas using a pusher mechanism.

The system is modular and uses multiple ROS2 nodes to represent individual hardware components and logical controllers.

**Notes on structure:**
- Each folder under `src/` is a separate ROS2 package.
- `scan_table_manager` contains the main FSM controlling the workflow.
- `mock_*` packages simulate hardware components for testing.
- Build artifacts (`install/`, `build/`) are generated by `colcon build`.
- Logs are stored under `log/` during execution.

## ROS2 Nodes

| Node | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scan_table_manager` | Central controller implementing the state machine. Coordinates scanning, pushing, and table readiness. |
| `mock_robot` | Simulates a robot placing items on the scan table. Waits for the table to be ready before placing the next item. |
| `mock_scanner` | Simulates barcode scanning, supports triggered or always-on mode. Publishes barcode messages. |
| `mock_pusher` | Simulates the pusher mechanism. Receives POCKET or REJECT commands and publishes completion status. |
| `mock_table_sensor` | Simulates table occupancy. Publishes whether the table is clear or occupied. |

## Dependencies

- ROS2 (Humble / Foxy / Rolling)
- C++17 for `scan_table_manager`
- Python 3 for mock nodes
- `std_msgs` ROS2 package

---

## Build Instructions

1. Source your ROS2 setup:

```bash
source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
````

2. Navigate to the workspace:

```bash
cd Automated_pick_and_place_cell/ros2_ws
```

3. Build the workspace:

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

4. Source the workspace:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## Running the System

You can launch each node individually for testing:

**Scan Table Manager:**

```bash
ros2 run scan_table_manager scan_table_manager
```

**Mock Robot:**

```bash
ros2 run mock_robot mock_robot
```

**Mock Scanner:**

```bash
ros2 run mock_scanner mock_scanner
```

**Mock Pusher:**

```bash
ros2 run mock_pusher mock_pusher
```

**Mock Table Sensor:**

```bash
ros2 run mock_table_sensor mock_table_sensor
```

---

## Workflow

1. Robot places an item on the scan table (`mock_robot` publishes `item_placed`).
2. ScanTableManager triggers scanners to collect barcodes.
3. After a scanning window, barcodes are evaluated.
4. The pusher (`mock_pusher`) is commanded to push the item to POCKET or REJECT.
5. The system waits for the table to be clear (`mock_table_sensor`) before signaling readiness for the next item.

---

## Notes

* The system is modular; new hardware nodes can be integrated without modifying the FSM.
* Mock nodes allow testing without physical devices.
* Logging provides traceability for debugging and testing.

This version is **ready to paste** into your `README.md` and will display properly on GitHub or any Markdown viewer.  

If you want, I can also **add a simple ASCII diagram of the state machine and node communication** so it looks more professional for your interview submission.  

Do you want me to do that?
