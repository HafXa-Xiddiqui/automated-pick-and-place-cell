# Automated Pick-and-Place Cell

## Overview

This project implements a ROS2-based automated pick-and-place cell.  
The system simulates a robotic workflow where items are placed on a scanning table, scanned for barcodes, and then sorted into pockets or reject areas using a pusher mechanism.

The system is modular and uses multiple ROS2 nodes to represent individual hardware components and logical controllers.

**Notes:**
- Each folder under `src/` is a separate ROS2 package.
- `scan_table_manager` contains the main FSM controlling the workflow.
- `mock_*` packages simulate hardware components for testing.
- Build artifacts (`install/`, `build/`) are generated by `colcon build`.
- Logs are stored under `log/` during execution.

## ROS2 Nodes

| Node | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scan_table_manager` | Central controller implementing the state machine. Coordinates scanning, pushing, and table readiness. |
| `mock_robot` | Simulates a robot placing items on the scan table. Waits for the table to be ready before placing the next item. |
| `mock_scanner` | Simulates barcode scanning, supports triggered or always-on mode. Publishes barcode messages. |
| `mock_pusher` | Simulates the pusher mechanism. Receives POCKET or REJECT commands and publishes completion status. |
| `mock_table_sensor` | Simulates table occupancy. Publishes whether the table is clear or occupied. |

## Dependencies

- ROS2 (Humble / Foxy / Rolling)
- C++17 for `scan_table_manager`
- Python 3 for mock nodes
- `std_msgs` ROS2 package

---

## Build Instructions

1. Source your ROS2 setup:
```bash
source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash
````

2. Navigate to the project root:

```bash
cd Automated_pick_and_place_cell
```

3. Build the workspace:

```bash
colcon build
```

4. Source the local setup:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

---

## Running the Nodes

You can launch the nodes individually for testing:

```bash
ros2 run scan_table_manager scan_table_manager
ros2 run mock_robot mock_robot
ros2 run mock_scanner mock_scanner
ros2 run mock_pusher mock_pusher
ros2 run mock_table_sensor mock_table_sensor
```

Or create launch files for coordinated testing.

## Notes

* The system is designed to be modular; you can replace mock nodes with real hardware drivers.
* Table occupancy safety checks ensure only one item is present at a time.
* Barcode scanning can operate in either triggered or always-on mode.
